Used /Test/Seed to generate 42335 events across 4234 streams

only time have been measured - memory-footprint rises with batchsize

Time to rebuild full readmodel state:

   Batchsize 1000: 14.8 seconds
   Batchsize 10000: 16.2 seconds
   Batchsize 200: 14.2 seconds
   Batchsize 50: 14.9 seconds
   Batchsize 500: 13.3 seconds
   
   42335 events at 13.3 seconds is a bit over 3183 events/sec
   That's 5.2 minutes for handling 1 million events
